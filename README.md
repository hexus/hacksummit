# Prolist

Project-focused list application. A hack.summit() hackathon project.

## About

This project was brought to life for the [hack.summit()](https://hacksummit.org/) [hackathon](https://www.koding.com/Hackathon) of 2016.

Unfortunately I didn't make enough time at the weekend to dedicate to the project, and [spent the entirety of the first day setting up the framework](https://github.com/hexus/hacksummit/compare/5c149627e29c6b3cf0de6c092ec094a30855da5e...88f76fea57d60f6d1ebbbadacc6f59a4db89bef9).</p>
<p>Herein lies a taster of what could have been. The app was intended as something similar to [Todoist](https://todoist.com), but for any kind of list, not just todo lists.</p>
<p>I would have tried to retain Todoist's fantastic focus on dates as well, except this would be across the board. Projects, lists, and list items would all be dated and searchable/listable by date.</p>
<p>The furthest I got was setting up anonymous no-login sessions with default projects that are editable and sortable on the front-end, but aren't persisted.</p>
<p>Regardless of not reaching my minimum viable product, I had fun hacking this together and found a great jQuery plugin for nested sortable lists in the process.</p>
<p>Cheers to the folks at hack.summit(),</p>
